# Integrating Melissa’s Express Entry with HubSpot Landing Pages

Some of the most powerful tools in a marketer’s toolkit are forms. Whether you’re offering a free trial, gathering customer information, or collecting data for direct mail campaigns, forms are essential. But if you’ve ever tried to collect validated addresses for use in your CRM, you know the pain of dealing with messy data. Typos, incorrect addresses, and — let’s be honest — the occasional fake address, all come with the territory.

If you’re in a business like lawn care, for example, where accurate addresses are crucial for routing, districting, or simply providing services, you’re probably all too familiar with the headache of handling inaccurate data. You’ve likely relied on open text fields for users to enter their addresses, but this method comes with its own set of problems—entering a street name incorrectly, missing a ZIP code, or even filling out a fake address. It’s a mess, and everyone involved suffers.

The good news? It doesn’t have to be this way anymore.

Thanks to Melissa’s **Express Entry** integration, you can now create a seamless user experience where addresses are auto-completed and validated in real time as users type them in. This eliminates the guesswork, reduces errors, and ensures that your CRM gets clean, reliable data every single time.

Here’s how to integrate **Melissa’s Express Entry** into a **HubSpot landing page** for a smooth, hassle-free address validation process.

## Why Not Use HubSpot's Native Form?

Before we dive in, let’s address the elephant in the room. HubSpot’s native form builder is fantastic in a lot of ways, but it doesn’t allow for direct integration with external services like **Melissa Express Entry**. To quote HubSpot’s support team directly:

> "If you’re using HubSpot's default form builder, you can’t directly edit the form's HTML or JavaScript within the HubSpot interface."

Okay, so what does this mean for us? It means that we can’t just slap an API into the default HubSpot form and call it a day. But don’t worry — we’re about to get creative.

Instead of relying on HubSpot’s default form, we’ll bypass the limitations and embed a **custom HTML form** into your landing page. With a bit of JavaScript magic, we’ll connect this form to the **Melissa Express Entry API**, enabling real-time address validation. The best part? The form will still connect to your HubSpot CRM, so all the data ends up in the right place.

## What You’ll Need:
- A **HubSpot account**
- An **API key** for **Melissa Express Entry**
- Basic knowledge of **HTML** and **JavaScript** (don’t worry, we’ll guide you step-by-step)

## Steps to Implement the Solution

### Step 1: Set Up Your HubSpot Landing Page and Form

**1.1 Create a New Landing Page**

- Log into HubSpot and navigate to **Content > Landing Pages**.
- Click **Create** in the top-right corner.
- Name your landing page something catchy — perhaps "Address Verification Form" or "Where Do You Live? We’re Not Stalking You."

**1.2 Create the HubSpot Form**

Next, we need to create the form that will capture the data from your users. To do this:
- Go to **Marketing > Forms**.
- Click **Create Form** and choose the **Legacy Editor**.
- Add these essential fields:
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Email Address
  - Address Line 1
  - Address Line 2
  - City
  - State
  - Zip Code
  - Country

These fields will correspond with **Melissa Express Entry**, ensuring that addresses are validated correctly. Make sure you don’t skip any of these—your form won’t work properly without them!

### Step 2: Building the Custom Landing Page Form

Now, let’s move on to the fun part — adding that **custom form** to your landing page using HTML.

**2.1 Remove Default Content**

HubSpot’s default landing pages often come with pre-existing content. Go ahead and delete this content so that we can start fresh.

**2.2 Add a Rich Text Module**

- From the left sidebar, drag a **Rich Text module** to where you want the form to appear on the page.
- Click on **Source Code** in the module settings, then paste the following **HTML code** for your form:

```html
<form>
  <h3>Address Verification Form</h3>
  First Name <input id="firstName" type="text">
  Last Name <input id="lastName" type="text">
  Phone Number <input id="phoneNumber" type="text">
  Email <input id="email" type="text">
  Address Line 1 <input id="addressLine1" type="text"> <span id="suggestions"></span>
  Address Line 2 <input id="addressLine2" type="text">
  City <input id="city" type="text">
  State <input id="state" type="text">
  Zip Code <input id="zipCode" type="text">
  Country <input id="country" type="text">
  <button id="submitButton">Submit</button>
</form>
```


**2.3 Save the Page**

Once your form is in place, **save the page**. The auto-complete magic will start happening here — as users type, address suggestions will start popping up.

### Step 3: Add the Backend Code

We’re almost there! Now, we need to add the **JavaScript code** that will integrate **Melissa Express Entry** with your form.

**3.1 Access the Footer HTML Section**

- Go to the settings of your landing page.
- Under the **Advanced** tab, find the **Footer HTML** section.

**3.2 Add the Backend Code**

Before adding the backend code, make sure to:
- **Update the form fields** to match what you’ve used on the page.
- **Reference the Melissa Express Entry API** in your script.

**3.3 Paste the JavaScript Code**

Now, **paste your custom backend code** into the **Footer HTML** section. This code will ensure the form interacts with **Melissa Express Entry**, enabling real-time address validation.

**3.4 Save and Test**

Once everything is saved, it’s time to **test**. Start typing an address and see if the suggestions populate as users type. Magic, right?

---

### Step 4: Finalize and Go Live

You’re nearly there! Time to get everything ready for the real world.

- **Publish** your landing page.
- **Test** the form thoroughly to ensure it’s capturing data correctly and validating addresses as expected.

Once everything looks good and is functioning smoothly, you’re ready to go live!
